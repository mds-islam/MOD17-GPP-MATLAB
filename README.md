# MOD17-GPP-MATLAB
MOD17 is an algorithm to simulate gross primary productivity (GPP) using light use efficiency principles. I created this script to implement the MOD17 model for a savanna ecosystem in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the model can be implemented anywhere with correct input variables and parameter values.
