Description of MATLAB scripts in "Saiful/GPP_Simulation_MATLAB/MATLAB_Script" directory:

There are four MATLAB code:

1. "full_gpp_dahra" contains step by step scripts to run, calibrate, validation, and sensitivity of the model. This script is linked to all other scripts.
2. "GPP_dahra" contains the main model.
3. "calibrate_gpp" contains the script for calculating RMSE before calibration.
4. "validate_gpp" contains the script for validation (RMSE after calibration).

Steps to run the entire model in "full_gpp_dahra" script (run each section seperately):

1. Set initial parameter (LUEmax value).
2. Run the model (it will call "GPP_dahra")
3. Run calibration. It will call "calibrate_gpp" and calculates RMSE before calibration. It is possible to define data length.
4. Run fminsearch. It will optimize LUEmax value with least RMSE and will provide a new LUEmax value in "Result" array, which is the new parameter.
5. Run the model again. It will call "GPP_dahra", but this time using new parameter.
6. Run validation. It will calculate RMSE after calibration. It is possible to define data length if calibration and validation dataset are different.
7. Run sensitivity. It is run the model for different LUEmax values.
8. Run calculate statistics. It will calculate RMSE and Total GPP of all model run.
